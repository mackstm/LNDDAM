                As a weapon which has its own depth of usage and requires a certain amount of training to be able 
                to master and fully use, the Great Sword is not just any big pointy stick. It can also block with 
                the R button, serving as a shield with slightly better protection than the Sword and Shield, as well 
                as a fast-draw shielding ability activated by holding down the R button and then pressing triangle and circle. 
                This shielding ability comes with a downfall, however, as each time you shield an attack the sword will lose sharpness.
