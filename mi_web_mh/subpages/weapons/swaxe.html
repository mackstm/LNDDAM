                The weapon has transformation capabilities, with one blade shifting while being sheathed as well as sliding to 
                a different position to change its attack style. In its secondary form, the weapon behaves far differently from 
                its standard variation and uses a phial of specialized coating to add certain effects to the weapon. 
                The weapon is also able to overload this phial, ending in a concentrated burst.

                It consists of two forms: Axe and Sword. The axe possesses a great range and can hit difficult-to-reach parts 
                of the monsters very easily, especially with the rising slash which can even hit a Rath's wing while it is flying. 
                It also has a potentially infinite combo which is limited by stamina. It consists of swinging the axe very quickly 
                from left to right and right to left after a rising slash. Apart from that, its power and mobility are similar to 
                Long Sword's without spirit bar effects.
